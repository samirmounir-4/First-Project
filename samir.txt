my name is samir mounir
whereever i go , people recognize me
call my name , share for me
but thier names noone shares for
Karmen, Rahma, Antoine, Lida, Joy, Marrico
if i called thier names i would write every single name on my body
but there are 805 million people suffering from hunger in world today
too many of them are chldren
they are struck by warn, natural disasters and extreme poverty
i have supporters from allover the world
begining today, i want this support to go to the people who really need it
because whenever you hear my name, you will think of thier names
and whenever you see my, you will see them ..
